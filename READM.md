Now that I have your attention...

Hi, I am Bhavya! I can solve almost all data-related agonies!!!
I am skilled in Python, SQL, R, Power BI, Tableau, Excel Automate. I have solved problems using Data Analytics, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, NLP, Time-series forecasting, and Data Mining.

I work as a research Assitant with Urban Europe Project and here are my humble contributions:

* Identified major KPIs for neighborhoods in Sweden, Uk and Germany which in turn, have helped to assess their performance patterns.

* Created a map that visualizes the georeferenced data (point geometries) leading to an understanding of better safe places to stay in the neighborhood.

* Forecasted the contributions in the households for males and females concerning in order to understand patterns for housing and neighborhood engagement.


I am more data-informed than data-driven. I want my data to tell stories that are relatable, understandable, and actionable which would aid data-informed business decisions.

If all of this sounds interesting to you and you are wondering if I would be good fit for your business, letâ€™s talk!
